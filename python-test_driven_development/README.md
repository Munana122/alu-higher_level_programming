# Addition Program in Python

## Introduction

This Python project demonstrates how to import a function from another file and use it to add two numbers. The result of the addition is printed in a formatted string using the `print` function.

## Files

- **add_0.py**: Contains the `add(a, b)` function, which adds two numbers and returns the result.
- **0-add.py**: The main script that imports the `add` function from `add_0.py`, assigns values to two variables `a` and `b`, and prints the result of their addition in a formatted string.

## Usage

1. Ensure that both `add_0.py` and `0-add.py` are in the same directory.
2. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 0-add.py
    ```

3. The expected output is:

    ```bash
    1 + 2 = 3
    ```

## Example

```bash
$ python3 0-add.py
1 + 2 = 3
